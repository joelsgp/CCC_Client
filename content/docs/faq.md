# CookieClickerCloud FAQ
CookieClickerCloud (or CCC) is a free service by [Tim Ittermann](https://timia2109.com). It allows you to save as much CookieClicker games you want on my server. Your game is just accessible by you so nobody can make any changes or something else.

## How do I save the game?
### Option 1: Popup
Open the popup on the right side of the Omnibox (or in the menu) and login if you're not already logged in. If you're on Cookie Clicker you only have to press on _save game_ and your game will be uploaded. If you are too lazy for clicking every minute you can click the _Save all 5 minutes_ Button and it will uploaded all 5 mins (or until you reload the page).
### Option 2: Shortcut
After you have logged in, you can use the Shortcut `CTRL`+`U` on CookieClicker to upload this game directly.

## How do I create an account?
Click on register and create an account. It's free and no mail is necessary.

## How long will the accounts / games exist?
Currently there is no limit for saved games and accounts. That means when you save a game it will remain for a long time (as long as I pay the server). 

## How many games can I save?
You can save as many games as you want, they are identifyed by the Backery Name. So if you want to save it under an other name just rename the backery and it's an other game.

## How safe is my password protected?
Your password will be hashed with SHA-256 so it's "impossible" to read it. It's also not possible to rehash. So the only chance to hack your password is to try every existing combination. So good luck!

## What can I do if I forgot my password?
You can't do anything, because I don't save mail addresses or something else. But you can create a new account and write me a mail. Then I can copy all saved games so that this is not lost.

## What are the Terms of usage?
 - I'm not responsible if your game is deleted
 - I'm not responsible if this addon breaks your game (you could simply delete the addon)
 - I took the Beautify(…) and the Game.backeryName(…) function of Orteil, so respect his work. This is his code!
 - Don't overload the server
 - The autosave time depends on the server usage. So don’t be angry if the autosave timeout becomes bigger

## Can you add....? | Can you change...? | Can you fix...?

I'm happy about every feedback :)
